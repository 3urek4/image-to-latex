# Image to Latex

## Quick Start

Clone the repository to your computer and position your command line inside the repository folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kingyiusuen/image-to-latex.git
cd image-to-latex
```

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/). Then, create a conda environment:

```sh
make conda-update

## Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by the labs in [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/). Although some of the modeling to make sure I am learning from it. For example,
- I wrote my own training loop instead of using Pytorch Lightning,
- I used Typer instead of argparser for CLI, and
- I used FastAPI intead of Flask for deployment.
